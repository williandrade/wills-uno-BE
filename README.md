# Yo! Welcome to Will's UNO Smackdown Server

Okay, so I got bored and decided to make my own UNO server.  Think of it as reverse engineering that classic card game, with a few of my own wild twists thrown in for fun.

## Wanna Play? Here's the Deal:

- This bad boy is built with Node.js. 
- You can play with your friends in real time.
- TypeScript is in the mix too. Because...why not?

## Get this Party Started

- Clone this repo (you know the drill).
- Run npm install to get all those fancy dependencies.
- Fire it Up (Dev Mode):

For hot reloading and all that good stuff, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Ready for the Real Deal (Production Mode)


Build that sucker: `npm run build`
Get that server humming:
```Bash
npm run start
```
Important Note:

This project is like that one pizza you keep messing with in the fridge â€“ it's always a work in progress.  Things might get a little wonky, and I might throw in some crazy new rules just for kicks.

Let's Build This Thing Together

Got some cool ideas? Bugs driving you nuts?  Hit me up with those issues and pull requests.  Let's make this UNO server the ultimate online smackdown!

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any friendships ruined or family feuds started because of this game. Play at your own risk, and try not to rage quit too hard! ðŸ˜‰
